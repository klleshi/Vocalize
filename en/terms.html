<p><strong>Last updated:</strong> [Enter Today's Date]</p>

<p>Welcome to [Your App Name]! These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your use of our mobile application ("Service"). Please read them carefully before using the app.</p>

<p>By accessing or using our Service, you agree to be bound by these Terms.</p>

<h3>1. Service Description</h3>
<p>[Your App Name] is a software application that provides Text-to-Speech (TTS) services. The Service allows users to convert text into audio, import content from files and web pages, and create and manage personal audiobook projects.</p>

<h3>2. Usage Plans & Features</h3>
<p>Our Service is offered under two plans: "Free" and "Premium".</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Free Plan:</strong> Limited access to synthesis voices (e.g., Standard and WaveNet), a monthly credit budget for synthesis, presence of third-party ads, and the audiobook creation feature is not available.</li>
  <li><strong>Premium Plan (requires an active subscription):</strong> Access to all features, including audiobook creation, access to all available voices including "Studio" quality voices, a higher monthly credit budget, and no ads.</li>
</ul>

<h3>3. Free Trial Period</h3>
<p>We offer a free trial period for the Premium Plan. The trial can be activated once per user account (Google/Apple). To activate the trial, you must begin the subscription process through the Google Play Store or Apple App Store. No charge will be made before the end of the trial period. At the end of the trial, the subscription will automatically renew at the chosen plan's price unless canceled before the expiration date through your store settings.</p>

<h3>4. Subscriptions, Payments, and Renewals</h3>
<p>Subscriptions to the Premium Plan are managed, billed, and charged by Google (for Android) and Apple (for iOS). All subscriptions automatically renew at the end of the billing period (monthly or yearly) unless deactivated. The user can cancel the auto-renewal of their subscription at any time directly from their Google Play or App Store account's subscription settings.</p>

<h3>5. Credit System</h3>
<p>The Service is based on a credit system consumed during speech synthesis. Each voice type has a different credit cost, which is indicated in the app. Users on the Free and Premium plans are allocated a monthly credit quota. Unused credits do not roll over and are reset upon monthly renewal.</p>

<h3>6. Acceptable Use</h3>
<p>The user agrees not to use the Service to create, save, or distribute illegal, offensive, defamatory, or rights-violating content, including copyright infringement. The user is solely responsible for the text they provide to the Service for synthesis.</p>

<h3>7. Intellectual Property</h3>
<p>All rights to the [Your App Name] application, its code, design, and brand are our exclusive property. The user retains full ownership and all rights to the text they input and the audio files they generate through the Service.</p>

<h3>8. Limitation of Liability</h3>
<p>The Service is provided "as is". We do not guarantee that the Service will always be available, error-free, or meet all user needs. To the maximum extent permitted by law, we shall not be liable for any direct or indirect damages arising from the use of or inability to use our Service.</p>

<h3>9. Changes to Terms</h3>
<p>We reserve the right to modify these Terms at any time. In the event of substantial changes, we will make an effort to notify you through the app or other means. Continued use of the Service after such changes constitutes acceptance of the new Terms.</p>
